Script for creating virtual machines with Debian.

This script was developed to speed up the creation of virtual machines using Debian.

Since I frequently use VMs — especially Debian-based ones — I created this script with the ideal configurations I commonly use in my daily workflow.

## Features

- Automatically creates a Virtualbox VM with Debian
- Sets up memory, VRAM, and disk size
- Configures bridged network
- Adds shared folder with host machine
- Attaches empty CD/DVD drive for ISO boot
